GarageBot — Right Part. First Time. Every Engine.
Built by DarkWave Studios

A comprehensive auto parts aggregator and vehicle management platform that unifies inventory from 68+ retailers across 16 product categories into a single searchable interface. Serves casual vehicle owners, professional mechanics, fleet managers, and motorized hobby enthusiasts.

Build Stats:

86,000+ lines of custom-written source code (server, shared schema, client application)
111,000+ lines total including configuration, templates, and workspace files
Note: A previous catalog listing cited ~693,000 lines of TypeScript. That figure inadvertently included 137,000+ lines of third-party package type definitions from the dependency cache, which inflated the count. The 86,000+ figure reflects actual project source code written for GarageBot.
