Description
TrustHome is a white-label real estate platform and central hub for all parties in a real estate transaction — agents, buyers, sellers, inspectors, mortgage brokers, title companies, appraisers, and contractors. It provides a unified, transparent, and efficient experience built on DarkWave's custom Layer 1 blockchain (Trust Layer) for universal trust and document verification.

The platform serves as both a client-facing portal (property search, showings, document vault, transaction timelines) and a full agent business suite (CRM, lead management, marketing hub, analytics, expense/mileage tracking). TrustHome is white-label ready for brokerages and includes a Founders Program for early adopter pricing.
