## Marketing Description

**TrustVault — Your Creative Vault. Your Rules.**

Stop scattering your photos, videos, music, and documents across a dozen apps. TrustVault is the all-in-one media vault and creative studio that keeps everything you create safely organized, beautifully displayed, and ready to edit — from any device.

Upload anything. Edit everything. Professional image, audio, and video editors are built right in — with AI-powered tools that auto-tag your uploads, remove backgrounds, generate captions, and even learn your personal aesthetic. Add text overlays to your videos, watermark your images, pick colors with an eyedropper, manage layers like the pros, and undo anything with a visual history timeline.

Combine media into collages, audio compilations, and video montages with 17 cinematic transition effects. Batch export your work in any format — resized for Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, or whatever platform you need.

Every family member gets their own private vault with PIN-secured access. Upgrade to unlock more storage, unlimited AI credits, and API access for your own apps. TrustVault is part of the Dark Wave Studios ecosystem — built on trust, designed for creators who demand more.
