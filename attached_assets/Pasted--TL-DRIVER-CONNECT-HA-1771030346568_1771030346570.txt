TL DRIVER CONNECT / HAPPY EATS — COMPLETE PLATFORM DESCRIPTION
Updated: February 13, 2026
=============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
TL Driver Connect (TLDC) is a nationwide web application designed to serve 
commercial and everyday drivers, food truck vendors, and office users. It 
provides a comprehensive suite of services including food delivery, parts 
access, concierge services, mileage/expense tracking, entertainment, weather, 
marketing tools, and a full affiliate referral program. The platform features 
a multi-tenant franchise model with isolated data, branding, and configurations 
per franchise, with Kathy's Nashville operation as the initial tenant.

Happy Eats is the food truck ordering arm of the platform, operating as a 
separate PWA with its own orange theme. It uses zone-based batch ordering in 
the Nashville I-24 Corridor with an 11 AM cutoff and batch deliveries.

Both platforms are part of the Trust Layer (dwtl.io) ecosystem, sharing a 
unified affiliate ID system for cross-platform referral tracking and rewards.
