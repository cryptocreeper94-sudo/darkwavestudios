TL Driver Connect / Happy Eats
Tagline: The All-in-One Platform for Drivers, Vendors & Businesses on the Road

What It Is
TL Driver Connect is a nationwide web application built for commercial drivers, everyday commuters, food truck vendors, and office professionals. It combines food delivery, business tools, marketing resources, real-time communication, and logistics services into a single platform. The companion brand, Happy Eats, powers the food ordering and delivery side — connecting food truck vendors with hungry customers across delivery zones.

The Problem It Solves
Drivers and mobile vendors operate in a fragmented world — juggling separate apps for food orders, expense tracking, route planning, marketing, and communication. Businesses along major corridors have limited access to quality food delivery. Food truck vendors lack affordable tools to manage menus, reach customers, and grow their business. TL Driver Connect brings it all together.
