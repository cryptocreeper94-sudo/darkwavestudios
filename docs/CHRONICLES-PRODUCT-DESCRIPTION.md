## What Chronicles Is

Chronicles is a historically-grounded AI life simulation. Not sci-fi, not dimensional — real history. You are the character. The world is history. Every choice echoes forward through a persistent world with no moral judgment and no end state.

## Core Philosophy

- You are the character — no avatar abstraction
- No moral judgment — the world reacts, it doesn't lecture
- Persistent world — your choices compound across time
- No end state — play as long as you want, death triggers the Parallel Self mechanic

## The 7 Historical Epochs

1. **Stone Age** — Survival, tribal politics, early tool use
2. **Bronze Age** — City-states, trade routes, early warfare
3. **Classical Antiquity** — Empires, philosophy, conquest
4. **Medieval Period** — Feudalism, crusades, guild systems
5. **Renaissance** — Art, science, exploration, political intrigue
6. **Industrial Revolution** — Factories, labor movements, empire expansion
7. **20th Century** — World wars, civil rights, technology, cold war

## The AI Engine

- **GPT-4o NPCs**: Every NPC is a full AI personality with memory, goals, and relationships
- **5-Axis Emotion System**: NPCs track emotions across 5 dimensions that influence behavior
- **Choice Echoes**: Your decisions create ripples (not archetypes) — the world remembers and adapts
- **Belief-Adaptive Narrative**: The story engine adapts to your character's evolving beliefs and values

## Gameplay Systems

- **Factions**: Join, betray, lead, or destroy political and social factions
- **Quest Tiers**: Multi-layered quest system from personal errands to epoch-defining events
- **The 7 Sigils**: Legendary quest line spanning all epochs
- **Estates**: Build, manage, and defend property across eras
- **Voice Cloning**: Your character speaks in your voice (ElevenLabs integration)
- **Scenario Generator**: AI-created custom scenarios based on your playstyle

## The Parallel Self

- **Death Mechanics**: Death doesn't end the game — it triggers emotional evolution
- **Emotional Evolution**: Your character's essence carries forward through the Parallel Self
- **Long-Term Character Development**: Decades of play create deeply layered personalities

## Blockchain Integration

- **Chronicle Proofs**: Key moments recorded on-chain as immutable proof of your story
- **SIG Economy**: In-game token economy for player-to-player trade
- **Player-Created Content**: Community-built scenarios and factions verified on-chain

## Playstyle Freedom

- **Adventurer**: Combat, exploration, conquest
- **Settler**: Building, farming, community
- **Observer**: Diplomacy, trade, knowledge
- **Hybrid**: Mix and match as your character evolves
